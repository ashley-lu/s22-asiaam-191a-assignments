            <ul>
                <li>My name is Ashley but you can call me Ash. If you didn't know I'm a Pokemon Master B)</li>
                <li>I'm a second year at UCLA majoring in Business Economics and intending to minor in Data
                Science Engineering and Digital Humanities.</li>
                <li>I'm actively involved in ACM (specifically the TeachLA and Studio committees), Creative Labs, and 
                DataRes on campus.</li>
                <li>My clubs are a good indication of what I like, but I am interested in accessible education, game
                development (particularly art and writing), design (I want to learn more!!), and data science.</li>
                <li>I like watching sports in my free time, particularly figure skating, golf, and gymnastics (tennis
                occasionally).</li>
                <li>I give coffee recommendations on this other page I made: <a href="more-stuff.html" style="color:yellow">Coffee!</a></li>
            </ul>

            Plugs in case people are interested in art + game dev that I've worked on, though my art Instagram has
            been dead for months :')

                You might be wondering who my Discord profile is. Why, it's the one and only Herlock Sholmes (not Sherlock
                Holmes due to copyright) from one of my favorite games, <em>The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles</em>. Here he is in all
                his glory:

            Anyway, enough about that; this is for a class after all :)

            <h2>About Map-Making</h2>
            <p>
                My experience with map-making mostly comes from doing data analysis for classes or club projects. I have 
                always found maps to be a great way to show information because they are very capable of telling stories
                about people and places. However, I've found that the ethical component associated with data is often
                omitted from classes and clubs, and so my goals for this class are to make meaningful maps that properly 
                represent the communities I'm trying to visualize. I want to make sure that I am not perpetuating power
                imbalances through my maps.
            </p>
