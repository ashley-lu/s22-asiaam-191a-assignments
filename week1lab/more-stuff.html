                Hm. Trying to come up with more things about me is hard. But I will say that I have a crippling
                coffee addiction (just kidding, I only drink like one cup of caffeinated a day) and I am getting
                into making my own coffee!
            </p>

            <p>
                If you're living in the dorms right now I would highly recommend getting an Aeropress. It barely 
                takes up any space if you're concerned about how much space an espresso machine takes up. Also
                it tastes better than french press and Keurig because it's less grainy and you can control what 
                grounds you're using, respectively.
            </p>

                You can find it at Westwood Target and it usually sells for $40 (but I got scammed and paid $45!!!).

                I will try to periodically update a list of all the coffee grounds I've tried and rank them based on
                taste, feel, notes, etc. Whatever coffee connoisseurs use to describe coffee. Hopefully by then this
                website will be a lot prettier too!
